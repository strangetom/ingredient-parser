Foundation foods
================

Explanation
^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``foundation_foods`` optional keyword argument for the :func:`parse_ingredient <ingredient_parser.parsers.parse_ingredient>` function enables the functionality that extracts the foundation foods from the ingredient sentence.

A foundation food is the core or fundamental item of an ingredient sentence, without any other words like descriptive adjectives or brand names.
For example, in the sentence

    1 large organic cucumber

the :func:`parse_ingredient <ingredient_parser.parsers.parse_ingredient>` function will identify the name as **organic cucumber**. The foundation food is **cucumber**.

.. code:: python

    >>> from ingredient_parser import parse_ingredient
    >>> parse_ingredient("1 large organic cucumber", foundation_foods=True)
    ParsedIngredient(
        name=IngredientText(text='organic cucumber',
                            confidence=0.997585),
        size=IngredientText(text='large',
                            confidence=0.987387),
        amount=[IngredientAmount(quantity=Fraction(1, 1),
                                 quantity_max=Fraction(1, 1),
                                 unit='',
                                 text='1',
                                 confidence=0.999895,
                                 starting_index=0,
                                 APPROXIMATE=False,
                                 SINGULAR=False,
                                 RANGE=False,
                                 MULTIPLIER=False,
                                 PREPARED_INGREDIENT=False)],
        preparation=None,
        comment=None,
        purpose=None,
        foundation_foods=[FoundationFood(text='cucumber',
                                         confidence=0.997391)],
        sentence='1 large organic cucumber'
    )

Examples
~~~~~~~~

The table below gives some examples of the foundation foods for different ingredient names.

+-----------------------------------------+-----------------+
| Name                                    | Foundation Food |
+=========================================+=================+
| canned plum tomatoes with juice         | tomatoes        |
+-----------------------------------------+-----------------+
| seedless grapes                         | grapes          |
+-----------------------------------------+-----------------+
| all-purpose flour                       | flour           |
+-----------------------------------------+-----------------+
| Granny Smith apples                     | apples          |

.. attention::

    The foundation foods are based on the `FoodData Central Foundation Foods <https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-search?type=Foundation&query=>`_ and `FooDB <https://foodb.ca>`_ databases.
    However, these databases does not perfectly align with how ingredients are referred to in recipes so you may find that examples where a foundation food from the :abbr:`FDC (FoodData Central)` database is not identified, or an identified foundation food is not in the :abbr:`FDC (FoodData Central)` database.

    Interpretation and extrapolation has been applied in the development of this functionality.


Limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^

The current approach to identifying foundation foods has a few limitations.

First, we rely on the specific tokens in the sentence to identify foundation foods. There will be cases where a foundation food uses a slightly different spelling or phrasing that is not part of the training data and therefore will not be identified as a foundation food.

Secondly, because of the reliance of the specific tokens in the sentence, we cannot identify foundation foods where the name is split. For example if the ingredient name is **red or yellow pepper**, only **yellow pepper** is identified. However **red pepper** is also a foundation food in that name, but is not identified.


Model
^^^^^

Identification of foundation foods is implemented as a separate :abbr:`CRF (Conditional Random Fields)` model. This model is trained on just the NAME tokens for each sentence in the training data, using the same features as the main parser model for each token. The model has two labels:

- FF: the token is a foundation food
- NF: the token is not a foundation food

The model can be trained using the following command

.. code::

    $ python train.py train --model foundationfoods --database train/data/training.sqlite3

.. tip::

    All the same options that can be used when training the parser model can also be used when training the foundation foods model. See :doc:`Training the model <training>` for more details.

.. note::

    See the `Foundation Food Model Card <https://github.com/strangetom/ingredient-parser/blob/master/ingredient_parser/en/FF_ModelCard.en.md>`_ for the current model performance.

The identified foundation foods are defined as the consecutive NAME tokens labelled with FF by the foundation foods model.
